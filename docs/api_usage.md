# Using `llm4s`: Basic API Example

This document provides a concise guide on how to interact with the `llm4s` API to generate text using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## **ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites**
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the example.

```scala
// Add this to your `build.sbt` file
libraryDependencies += "com.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % "0.1.0"
```

## **ðŸš€ Example: Generating Text using LLM**
```scala
import llm4s.LLMModel

object LLMExample {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val model = LLMModel("gpt-4") 
    val prompt = "What are the benefits of Scala for AI development?"
    val response = model.generate(prompt)
    println(s"Response: $response")
  }
}
```

## **ðŸ›  Running the Example**
Compile and execute the program using the following commands:

```bash
sbt compile
sbt run
```
